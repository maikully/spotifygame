The Spotify Game!

Play The Spotify Game online with your friends! Each round, a rotating host chooses an artist. Everyone else must try to guess an artist with a Spotify monthly popularity rating as close to the host's target's rating as possible. Whoever is the closest wins that round!

To run locally:

```sh
cd frontend
npm i
npm start
```

Make sure ```isLocal``` in ```App.js``` is set to ```true```!
